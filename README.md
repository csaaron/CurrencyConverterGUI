## Dependencies 
Building this solution requires the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet Package available through the NuGet Package Manager.

## API
The public API used to update the local database can is found at https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ Currently my API key is contained within the source code but will be removed in a matter of days.

## Issues
There are currently no known issues, however if there is a problem importing the local database I can be contacted through email.
